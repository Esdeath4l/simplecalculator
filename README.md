*Simple Calculator C++ Project*

A basic calculator program implemented in C++ that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

*Project Overview*

This project is a console-based calculator that takes in user input for two numbers and an operator, and then performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The program uses C++'s built-in data types and operators to perform calculations.

*Features*

- Performs basic arithmetic operations:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
- Takes user input for numbers and operator
- Displays result of calculation
- Handles invalid user input and division by zero errors

*Technical Details*

- Implemented in C++ programming language
- Uses C++'s built-in data types (int, float, char)
- Utilizes C++'s arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)

*Example Use Cases*

- Run the program and enter two numbers and an operator to perform a calculation
